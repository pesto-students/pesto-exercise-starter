My name is prashant kumar singh, i am a BCA graduate,i live in New delhi, i have over 4 years of exerience in Front-end Development, i work in technologies like, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, TYPESCRIPT, GIT, Angular etc. I have started my career as a Web designer than i developed my interest in Frontend so i started working in javascript and other related technologies, i got 3 promotions in my 1st job. I have good experience in JS, i have worked with APIs and Because of my interest i am eagar to learn React js and Node on my own.

I have working on a project for Childrens finding a Good tution teacher, in which teacher have to give test to teach students, so i am using Angular with NgRx to build this project and NgRx really fasinated me a lot in recent times, i'm still exploring the posibilities to make the website faster while using NgRx, i think this would be one of my Best project i have done till now. The challenge in this project is to make the website fast as possible, cause while calling multiple APIs and sending so much data from one component to another, website gets really slow. Very much eagar to sort this out in the best way possible.

Thank you
