## Adding `.env` file
If you are getting the warning
```
WARNING: Consider adding GITHUB_API_KEY to an .env file in the root directory.
```
then you can add an `.env` file in the root directory with your GITHUB api key.
You can refer to this [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to generate your own token. 

Here's an example of an `.env` file:
```
GITHUB_API_KEY=here_goes_your_api_key
```

**You do NOT need to check any checkbox in "Select Scopes" section.** The token is just used to extend the rate limit for downloading files from Github.

- Don't download any extra dependency for solving any question. You can only use internal node modules.
- A solution will not be considered complete until an implementation and a test file are both provided.
    - For example â€” if the question is to code `add` function, then `add.js` should contain the implementation and `add.test.js` should contain the test cases.
    - For some questions, test cases are provided. **For questions where test cases are missing, you need to add them.**
    - Write tests for all the questions using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- For daily exercises the pull request should be created before 8 PM (IST) the next day.
- For long exercises the pull request should be created before 8 PM (IST) on Monday.
- Your homework will not be counted as complete if the pull request is not created within the above time frame.
